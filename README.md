# EC601Mini_Project_2
This project is mini project 2 of EC601

## Dataset
Dataset Souces:https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition#flowers.zip

## Training models
1. Train_CNN.py is based on a self build CNN model which can achieve an accuracy of about 85%. 
2. Keras_Model.py is a model which imports keras library which can achieve an accuracy of about 92%.
3. Keras_Model.h5 is the machine learning model trained by Kares_Model.py by using the dataset above. You can use it directly or train the model by yourself.

## Predict 
Keras_Predict is used to test the machine learning model trained by Keras_Model.py.
